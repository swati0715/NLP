# NLP
TextClassifier-ML-NLP A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on text classification using machine learning techniques like TF-IDF and Logistic Regression. The project demonstrates a complete pipeline from text preprocessing to model evaluation. Python NLP License Status

📌 Project Description:- This project involves building a text classification model to categorize textual data into multiple classes. It includes preprocessing steps like lowercasing, stopword and punctuation removal, followed by feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer. The final classification is performed using Logistic Regression, with accuracy and classification reports used to evaluate model performance.
